# üéØ Simple Testing Guide - User Story 1

## What We're Testing
**User Story**: A new fight academy wants to buy a license of the Oss365 app to create and manage their own data with 20 students.

## Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Node.js (you have v22.20.0)
- ‚úÖ npm (you have v10.9.3)
- ‚ùå Docker (not needed for this simple test)

## Step-by-Step Testing

### Step 1: Set Up the Backend

1. **Navigate to the server folder:**
   ```powershell
   cd server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create environment file:**
   ```powershell
   copy env.example .env
   ```

4. **Edit the .env file** (you can use Notepad or any text editor):
   ```
   PORT=5000
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/jiu_jitsu_academy_db"
   JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key_for_testing"
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN="1h"
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up a Simple Database (SQLite for Testing)

Since you don't have Docker, let's use SQLite for testing. Let me create a simple version:

1. **Install SQLite dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   npm install sqlite3
   ```

2. **Create a simple database setup script**

### Step 3: Test the Academy Creation

1. **Run the academy creation script:**
   ```powershell
   npm run create-academy
   ```

### Step 4: Test the Frontend

1. **Start the React app:**
   ```powershell
   cd ..
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser and go to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/login
   ```

3. **Test login with these credentials:**
   - **Domain:** `elite-combat.jiu-jitsu.com`
   - **Email:** `admin@elite-combat.com`
   - **Password:** `EliteAdmin2024!`

## What Should Happen

‚úÖ **Success Indicators:**
- Academy creation script runs without errors
- You can log in to the frontend
- You see the Elite Combat Academy dashboard
- You can see 20 students in the Students section
- You can see 5 classes in the Classes section
- Data is isolated from the original OSS365 Academy

## Troubleshooting

**If you get errors:**
1. Make sure you're in the right folder
2. Check that all dependencies are installed
3. Verify the .env file is created correctly
4. Check the console for error messages

**Common Issues:**
- **Database connection error**: We'll use SQLite instead of PostgreSQL
- **Port already in use**: Change the PORT in .env to 5001
- **Module not found**: Run `npm install` again

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you confirm everything works:
1. ‚úÖ New academy is created
2. ‚úÖ 20 students are set up
3. ‚úÖ You can log in and manage data
4. ‚úÖ Data is isolated between tenants

Then we can move to the next user story!
