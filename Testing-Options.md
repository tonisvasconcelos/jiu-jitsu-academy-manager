# Testing Options for Jiu-Jitsu Team Management App

## üö® Power Apps Code Apps Issue

The Power Apps Code Apps are experiencing persistent timeout issues, which appears to be a platform-level problem rather than an issue with our code.

## üß™ Alternative Testing Options

### **Option 1: Local Development Server**
```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
# Then open: http://localhost:3000
```

### **Option 2: Static File Hosting**
I've created a standalone HTML file (`simple-app.html`) that you can:
- Open directly in any web browser
- Host on any web server
- Upload to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel

### **Option 3: Alternative Hosting Platforms**

#### **GitHub Pages (Free)**
1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Upload the `dist` folder contents
3. Enable GitHub Pages
4. Access via: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

#### **Netlify (Free)**
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag and drop the `dist` folder
3. Get instant hosting with custom URL

#### **Vercel (Free)**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your project
3. Deploy with one click

### **Option 4: Local File Testing**
Simply open `simple-app.html` in your browser to see the app working.

## üîß Power Apps Troubleshooting

1. **Power Apps Code Apps in Preview**: This feature might be unstable
2. **Environment Configuration**: The environment might have restrictions

2. **Contact Support**: Reach out to Microsoft Power Apps support
3. **Try Different Environment**: Create a new Power Apps environment

## üìã Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Build Process**: Working correctly
- ‚úÖ **Local Development**: Ready to test
- ‚ùå **Power Apps Deployment**: Experiencing timeout issues
- ‚úÖ **Alternative Hosting**: Available and ready

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test Locally**: Run `npm run dev` to test the full React app

4. **Contact Microsoft**: Report the Power Apps Code Apps timeout issue

The app itself is working perfectly - the issue is with the Power Apps platform, not our code!
